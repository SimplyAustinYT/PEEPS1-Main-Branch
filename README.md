# PEEPS1-Main-Branch
The Peoples Console V1

#MAP:

Upload of original files and master theme to be used in Emulation Station.  Currently only tested on ODROID XU4.

FINISHED       = Master of raw png files.
THEME GAME ART = Master of raw art files
peeps1         = Master of raw theme

#SUMMARY:

At the moment this is very early days, just innitial upload of WIP files.  This I hope will be a community 
involved theme to be able to be used by everyone and created by everyone. Its a start so lets see where this goes.

#CURRENT STATE:

Right now we are up to around 25 systems including Settings, Last Played and Faves. This should be "most" of the 
main systems in UK and US normally play.  More systems will be added as the theme is worked on including regional 
variations.  Maybe once up to a stable stage language variations will also be added.

Right now, theme is broken.  Only 2 people have been working on this along with SARGE from the ORA Team (Odroid 
Retro Arena) and myself (Simply Austin).  At the moment the theme itself is WIP and art needs to be 
configured/organized with the theme.  If anyone would like to help or have anything they could add, please get in 
touch through email.

#SUPPORTED SYSTEMS:

We are working on all main systems, but as this theme is per system themed, it takes time.  Once all main systems is added, work will start on collections too.  If anyone would like to contribute, please do.  You can also get in touch with me on my Discord for more info etc - https://discord.gg/Qpg7qxn

#*WARNING* 

At the moment this is WIP and at ALPHA stage.  Even the PSD files are unchecked and uncleaned.  
Once I get time to commit to this I will go through, check and clean up once project is at least on first test.

Some assets and artwork such as logos, backdrops etc have been used more as place holders at this point.  Much of 
the art needs cleaning and finalising.  If anyones work has been used and are not happy about "transformative" 
it is, or would like to be involved, please contact me directly on the email provided.

All work is public and open source. Please respect the license provided.
