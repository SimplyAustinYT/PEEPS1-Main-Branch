# PEEPS1-Main-Branch
The Peoples Console V1

#DESCRIPTION

The Peeps theme is a theme that is univeral to be used on everything that is supported by this format.  At the moment just EmulationStation, meaning ODROID, Raspberry Pi, Android and PC.  Although universal each system has its own taste, theme, art and in some cases layout.  Each one of these options can be changed individually for every system on the same theme.  Meaning that the theme can be very unique, highly customizable and completely trasformative depending on the system and of course your taste.

#MAP:

Upload of original files and master theme to be used in Emulation Station.  Currently only tested on ODROID XU4.

FINISHED       = Master of raw png files.

#SUMMARY:

At the moment this is very early days, just innitial upload of WIP files.  This I hope will be a community 
involved theme to be able to be used by everyone and created by everyone. Its a start so lets see where this goes.

#CURRENT STATE:

Right now we are up to around 25 systems including Settings, Last Played and Faves. This should be "most" of the 
main systems in UK and US normally play.  More systems will be added as the theme is worked on including regional 
variations.  Maybe once up to a stable stage language variations will also be added.

The theme is at this stage in WIP.  Its up to the standard where it can be used.  But still much tweaking and work to be done.  As things are completed, the GitHub will be updated.


#SUPPORTED SYSTEMS:

We are working on all main systems, but as this theme is per system themed, it takes time.  Once all main systems is added, work will start on collections too.  If anyone would like to contribute, please do.  You can also get in touch with me on my Discord for more info etc - https://discord.gg/Qpg7qxn

#*WARNING* 

At the moment this is WIP and at ALPHA stage.  Even the PSD files are unchecked and uncleaned.  
Once I get time to commit to this I will go through, check and clean up once project is at least on first test.

Some assets and artwork such as logos, backdrops etc have been used more as place holders at this point.  Much of 
the art needs cleaning and finalising.  If anyones work has been used and are not happy about "transformative" 
it is, or would like to be involved, please contact me directly on the email provided.

All work is public and open source. Please respect the license provided.
